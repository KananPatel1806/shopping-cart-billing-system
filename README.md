# shopping-cart-billing-system
A console-based Python application that simulates a real-world shopping cart with discount logic, GST calculation, and bill generation saved as a text file. Includes 50 products and supports item selection, quantity input, and automatic billing.



This shopping cart program is a console-based Python application designed to simulate a real-world shopping experience. It begins by welcoming the user and displaying discount rules based on the total purchase amount. It contains a dictionary of 50 essential products, each mapped with a unique number and price. The user is prompted to enter their name and can then browse the product list. Inside a loop, users can choose products by number, specify the quantity, and add them to a virtual cart. The total amount is dynamically updated, and once shopping is complete, the program applies a discount based on predefined slabsâ€”15%, 25%, or 50%, depending on the total value. After applying the discount, 18% GST is calculated and added to the discounted amount to generate the final bill. The program then prints a detailed bill summary, including each item's quantity, unit price, and total cost. Additionally, the entire bill is saved to a text file named bill.txt, which includes the customer's name, date and time, and full billing details. This project demonstrates the use of Python fundamentals like loops, conditionals, functions, error handling, dictionaries, and file operations, making it a practical example of real-time billing systems.
